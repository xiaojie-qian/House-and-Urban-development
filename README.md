# House-and-Urban-development
*The data sets are based on the American Housing Survey, AHS, national files from 1985 onwards. Housing-level variables include information on the number of rooms in the housing unit, the year the unit was built, whether it was occupied or vacant, whether the unit was rented or owned, whether it was a single unit or multi unit structure, the number of units in the building, the current market value of the unit and measure of relative housing costs. The dataset also includes variables describing the number of people living in the household, household income and the type of residential area. Example, urban or suburban. These are made available to the public by the US department of housing and urban development. These data are made available every two years. The latest data being available for year 2013. For our project we'll be using data from year 2005 onwards. That is we will use the data from 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013.*
