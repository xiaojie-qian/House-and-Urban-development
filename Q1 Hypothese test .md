# Question:
**Q1-1: Are there some differences in the Market values of occupied versus not occupied housing units?**
<br>
*Difference in the Market Values is significant only for years 2005 and 2011. In these years the market value of 'Occupied' units was greater than 'Not-Occupied' units.
For the remaining years there is no significant difference in the market value across 'Occupied' and 'Not-Occupied' units.*

<br>

**Q1-2: Do these differences have a pattern over the period 2005 through 2013?**
<br>
*The pattern discernable is that the Market value of 'Occupied' units is never less than that for 'Not-Occupied' units. It is either greater (as in years 2005 and 2011) or equal (as in the remaining years).*
